Just follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v_fgW2SkkQ&list=PLqZXAkvF1bPNQER9mLmDbntNfSpzdDIU5 to know about LangChain, not many interesting things.

*Note*

Something such as APIs are deprecated, e.g. `Chain.run` -> `Chain.invoke`

Probably without OpenAI API usage, using open source model instead, with the guidance of [Official documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart/)
